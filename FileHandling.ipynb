        "- Most applications spend a lot of time \"waiting\"—waiting for a file to read from a disk, waiting for a database to return a query, or waiting for a website to respond to a request. This is called being I/O Bound.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Multithreading allows the CPU to switch to a different thread while one thread is stuck waiting for a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Instead of downloading 10 images one after another, you can start 10 threads to download them all at once, drastically reducing the total time taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compared to Multiprocessing (which creates entirely separate copies of a program), threads are very lightweight.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Because all threads within a process share the same memory space, they can share data and variables instantly without needing complex \"Inter-Process Communication\" (IPC) tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Creating a new thread is much faster and consumes significantly less RAM than starting a whole new process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modern computers have multiple CPU cores. Multithreading allows an application to distribute tasks across these cores. Even though Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that prevents multiple threads from executing Python code at the exact same time, many libraries (like NumPy or internal I/O operations) can bypass this lock to achieve true parallel execution."
